So, it all began with the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany, where I am going to study for my EE Master's degree. I lock myself in my apartment to protect others (actually, to protect myself) and enjoy the time to preview the future study. But it ends up that I play TOMB RAIDER all day long (for just one day, don't worry papa. Damn you, STEAM). Afterward, the guilt of laziness overwhelms me...

Shit, I gonna do something. Boom, there you have it -- a website of mine.
