The purpose of this project is to design a noise mapping tool in MATLAB accompanied
by a GUI that is responsible for simulating the noise map generated by an aircraft in the
vicinity of the Düsseldorf airport. The tool shall be capable of simulating sound propagation
through homogeneous and inhomogeneous media. The GUI shall be responsible
for displaying the computed noise levels for a position on the flight path chosen by the
user.
