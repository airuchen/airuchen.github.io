NeuronBot2 is the main task of mine as an intern. It is the latest version of NeuronBot made by ADLINK, which fully supports ROS1 and ROS2. 

From this project, I learned about how a project is processed, how to negotiate and cooperate with other companies, and, of course, leveled up my coding skill. 

Appreciate all my colleagues in ARPG of ADLINK.
